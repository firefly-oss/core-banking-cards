- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Card status management (block, suspend, reactivate)
- PIN management and security
- 3D Secure implementation for online transactions
- Tokenization for secure digital payments
- Security alerts and notifications
- Compliance with industry security standards

## Security Layers

### 1. Data Protection

Ensures that sensitive card data is securely stored, transmitted, and processed in compliance with industry standards.

### 2. Authentication

Verifies the identity of cardholders through various methods such as PIN, 3D Secure, and biometrics.

### 3. Authorization

Controls transaction approvals based on predefined rules, limits, and risk assessments.

### 4. Monitoring

Continuously monitors card activities to detect suspicious patterns and potential fraud.

### 5. Response

Implements rapid response mechanisms to address security incidents and minimize potential damage.

## Entities Involved

- **CARD**: Central entity with security status and settings
- **CARD_ACTIVITY**: Records of security-related activities
- **CARD_TRANSACTION**: Transactions monitored for fraud
- **CARD_LIMIT**: Security limits applied to transactions
- **CARD_CUSTOMER**: Customer information for authentication

## Fraud Detection Rules

The Core Banking Cards Service implements various fraud detection rules:

1. **Velocity Checks**: Detects unusual frequency of transactions
2. **Amount Pattern Analysis**: Identifies unusual transaction amounts
3. **Geographic Analysis**: Flags transactions from high-risk locations
4. **Merchant Category Monitoring**: Identifies transactions at high-risk merchant categories
5. **Time-of-Day Analysis**: Detects transactions at unusual times
6. **Device Intelligence**: Monitors transactions across different devices
7. **Behavioral Analysis**: Compares transactions against cardholder's normal behavior
8. **Network Intelligence**: Utilizes card network fraud detection systems
